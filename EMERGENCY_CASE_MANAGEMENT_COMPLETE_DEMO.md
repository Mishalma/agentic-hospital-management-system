## üöÄ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Emergency Case
```javascript
// Patient arrives with severe chest pain
const criticalCase = {
  chiefComplaint: "Severe chest pain with shortness of breath",
  symptoms: ["chest pain", "difficulty breathing", "sweating", "nausea"],
  vitals: {
    systolicBP: 200,
    diastolicBP: 110,
    heartRate: 130,
    temperature: 37.8,
    oxygenSaturation: 88,
    respiratoryRate: 28,
    painScale: 9
  },
  arrivalMode: "Ambulance"
}

// AI Triage Result:
// Priority: Critical
// Score: 11/12
// Risk Factors: ["Critical Blood Pressure", "Low Oxygen Saturation", "Critical Symptom: chest pain"]
// Action: "Immediate resuscitation required - Activate trauma team"
```

### Scenario 2: Deterioration Prediction
```javascript
// Patient with worsening vitals over time
const deteriorationCase = {
  vitalsHistory: [
    { systolicBP: 140, heartRate: 90, oxygenSaturation: 95, timestamp: "10:00" },
    { systolicBP: 130, heartRate: 110, oxygenSaturation: 92, timestamp: "10:30" },
    { systolicBP: 120, heartRate: 130, oxygenSaturation: 88, timestamp: "11:00" }
  ]
}

// Deterioration Prediction:
// Risk: High
// Confidence: 85%
// Recommendations: [
//   "Increase monitoring frequency to every 15 minutes",
//   "Consider ICU consultation",
//   "Review current treatment plan"
// ]
```

### Scenario 3: Resource Allocation
```javascript
// Multiple patients with different priorities
const activeCases = [
  { priority: "Critical", arrivalTime: "10:00" },
  { priority: "High", arrivalTime: "09:45" },
  { priority: "Medium", arrivalTime: "09:30" }
];

const availableResources = [
  { id: "trauma1", type: "trauma_bay", status: "available" },
  { id: "acute1", type: "acute_bed", status: "available" }
];

// Allocation Result:
// Critical case ‚Üí Trauma Bay 1
// High case ‚Üí Acute Bed 1
// Medium case ‚Üí Waiting queue (estimated wait: 45 minutes)
```
