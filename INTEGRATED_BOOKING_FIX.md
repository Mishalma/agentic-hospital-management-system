# Integrated Booking Fix

## Issue
The IntegratedBooking component was showing "Too many re-renders" error and "Failed to book appointment" message.

## Root Causes

### 1. Infinite Re-render Loop
- **Problem**: Validation functions were called directly in JSX render
- **Solution**: Created computed validation states instead of function calls

### 2. Missing API Endpoint
- **Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/appointments/book-integrated` which didn't exist
- **Solution**: Added the integrated booking endpoint to handle patient creation + appointment booking

## Changes Made

### Frontend (IntegratedBooking.js)
- Fixed infinite re-render by replacing function calls with computed states
- Added debugging logs to track API calls
- Fixed navigation URLs

### Backend (routes/appointments.js)
- Added `/book-integrated` POST endpoint
- Handles both patient creation and appointment booking in one request
- Supports both new and existing patients
- Includes proper validation and error handling

## How It Works
1. Frontend sends patient + appointment data to `/api/appointments/book-integrated`
2. Backend checks if patient exists by phone number
3. Creates new patient if needed, or uses existing patient
4. Creates appointment with proper validation
5. Returns confirmation data with patient ID and appointment token

## Testing
- Restart backend server to pick up new route
- Fill out patient form completely
- Select department, doctor, date, time, and symptoms
- Submit to test the integrated booking flow
