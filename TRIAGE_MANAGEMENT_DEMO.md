# Triage Management Software

## Overview
AI-powered web-based triage tool that prioritizes patients based on symptoms and vitals using risk scoring algorithms. Replaces paper-based processes with digital efficiency.

## Features

### üö® **Smart Risk Assessment**
- **AI-Based Scoring**: Automated risk calculation (0-100 scale)
- **Symptom Analysis**: Weighted scoring based on symptom type, severity, and duration
- **Vital Signs Integration**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation
- **Medical History**: Considers existing conditions and their severity

### üìä **Priority Classification**
- **5-Level Triage System**: 
  - Level 1 (Critical) - Immediate attention
  - Level 2 (High) - Urgent care within 15 minutes
  - Level 3 (Medium) - Less urgent, 1 hour wait
  - Level 4 (Low) - Non-urgent, 2 hour wait
  - Level 5 (Routine) - Routine care, 4 hour wait

### üè• **Queue Management**
- **Automated Prioritization**: Patients sorted by triage level and risk score
- **Real-time Updates**: Live queue status with position tracking
- **Status Tracking**: Pending ‚Üí In Assessment ‚Üí Waiting Doctor ‚Üí Completed
- **Staff Assignments**: Nurse assignment and workflow management

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Symptom Scoring
High-risk symptoms receive higher scores:
- **Chest Pain**: 15-40 points (severity dependent)
- **Difficulty Breathing**: 20-45 points
- **Severe Bleeding**: 25-50 points
- **Unconsciousness**: 40-60 points
- **Fever**: 5-20 points
- **General Symptoms**: 3-15 points

### Duration Multipliers
- **<1 hour**: 1.2x (recent onset = higher priority)
- **1-6 hours**: 1.0x (standard)
- **6-24 hours**: 0.8x (established condition)
- **>24 hours**: 0.6x (chronic condition)

### Vital Signs Scoring
- **Critical BP**: ‚â•180/120 (+20 points)
- **High BP**: ‚â•160/100 (+15 points)
- **Low BP**: <90/60 (+12 points)
- **Tachycardia**: >120 bpm (+15 points)
- **Bradycardia**: <50 bpm (+15 points)
- **High Fever**: ‚â•103¬∞F (+15 points)
- **Low O2**: <90% (+20 points)
- **Severe Pain**: 8-10/10 (+15 points)
