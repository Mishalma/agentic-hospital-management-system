# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Emergency Case Management Software is designed to digitize and streamline emergency room case documentation and prioritization. The system will provide real-time tracking of emergency cases from registration through disposition, with AI-powered triage scoring and resource allocation. The solution will integrate with existing MongoDB infrastructure and maintain a separate emergency database for optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an ER nurse, I want to register new emergency cases quickly, so that patients can be immediately entered into the system for tracking and triage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a patient arrives at the ER THEN the system SHALL allow registration with basic patient information within 30 seconds
2. WHEN registering a case THEN the system SHALL capture patient demographics, chief complaint, and arrival time
3. WHEN pre-hospital data is available THEN the system SHALL allow input of ambulance vitals and paramedic notes
4. IF a patient is already in the system THEN the system SHALL link the new emergency case to existing patient records

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an ER physician, I want an AI-powered triage system to prioritize cases, so that critical patients receive immediate attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a case is registered THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate an initial triage score based on chief complaint and vitals
2. WHEN vital signs are entered THEN the system SHALL update the triage priority in real-time
3. WHEN triage assessment is completed THEN the system SHALL assign cases to appropriate priority queues (Critical, Urgent, Less Urgent, Non-Urgent)
4. IF vital signs indicate deterioration THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate the case priority and alert staff

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an ER charge nurse, I want to view real-time case queues and track patient flow, so that I can manage resources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all active cases organized by triage priority
2. WHEN a case status changes THEN the system SHALL update the queue display in real-time
3. WHEN cases are waiting too long THEN the system SHALL highlight overdue cases with visual indicators
4. WHEN viewing case details THEN the system SHALL show complete timeline from arrival to current status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an ER physician, I want to document treatment orders and track case progress, so that care is coordinated and documented properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN treating a patient THEN the system SHALL allow entry of treatment orders, medications, and procedures
2. WHEN orders are entered THEN the system SHALL timestamp all actions and track completion status
3. WHEN case disposition is determined THEN the system SHALL record discharge, admission, or transfer decisions
4. WHEN a case is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report for medical records

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an ER administrator, I want to track quality metrics and resource utilization, so that I can improve department efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cases are completed THEN the system SHALL calculate door-to-doctor times, length of stay, and other key metrics
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide daily, weekly, and monthly statistics
3. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and resource allocation patterns
4. IF metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for quality improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the emergency system to use a separate MongoDB database, so that performance is optimized and data is properly organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to a dedicated emergency MongoDB database
2. WHEN storing case data THEN the system SHALL use optimized collections for emergency-specific workflows
3. WHEN integrating with existing systems THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency across databases
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and retry mechanisms
